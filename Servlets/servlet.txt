Web Server - is a computer that is designed to handle http requests. 

Servlet - is a Java object designed to handle incoming requests, not solely http.
can generate responses and process requests using Java logic

Servlet Container - it contains one to many servlets and is primarily responsible
for mapping the servlets to different addresses. configures our servlets

Tomcat - server designed by Apache that will host or house our servlet Container

web.xml (deployment descriptor) - gives the servlet container mapping and configuration details
decides what requests are handled by what server

servlet lifecycle - 
1. servlet class loaded into the servlet container
2. servlet class is instantiated
3. servlet's init() method is called
the init method of the servlet class is run only once and sets up initial configurations/parameters
-lazy: init is called upon the request to a servlet
-eager: init is called as soon as the application starts
4. servlet service() method is called upon each request to the servlet
service method delegates the request to doGet(), doPost(), doDelete()...
5. servlet destroy() method is only called once and that is when the application is shutdown

ServletConfig - object specific to a single servlet that holds information on that servlet

ServletContext - object that holds information about the entire container and thus all servlets

uri - uniform resource identifier
identifies a file or resource/servlet

url - uniform resource locator
host + port + uri 

forward - occurs on the server side and sends a request from one servlet to another

redirect - a resource tells the client to send another request to a different location

session handling - 
1. httpsession object - keeps track of session server side
2. cookie - store info client side 

Do not recommend list
3. url rewriting
4. hidden forms
